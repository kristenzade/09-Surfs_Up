## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to determine the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round

## Purpose
 Determine the Summary Statistics for June
 Determine the Summary Statistics for December

## Results: 

### Deliverable 1: Summary Statistics for June
  #### 1: Oahu observes higher mean temperature in June of 74.9 
  #### 2: 75% percentile recorded temperature of 77
  #### 3: Even minimum temperature recorded was 64


### Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics for December
  #### 1: Oahu observes lower mean temperature in December of 71 
  #### 2: 75% percentile recorded temperature of 74
  #### 3: Minimum temperature recorded was 56

## Summary of results: 
 
Although maximum temperature recorded in Oahu was almost similar in June and December, June was  hotte with mean of 74.9 and in December it was 71. Additionally, 75% percentile recorded temperature was also higher in June.
